    Mirrors ``app.pipeline.extractor.ExtractionResult``, following the same

    (``ClassificationResult`` / ``DraftResponse``) rather than importing the
    pipeline types: these are the wire contract, the pipeline's are the internal
    one, and the two are free to move independently.

    The submission/forum identifier fields are LISTS — an email may legitimately
    name several submissions, and reporting one silently discarded the rest. The
    two OpenReview reply signals are SCALARS: each names one specific thing (a
    single comment; a single sender address), so a list of them would carry no
    usable meaning.

    ``method`` is part of the contract, not decoration: it says WHICH path
    produced these values, so a consumer can tell the model's answer from a
    weaker regex guess. It does NOT describe ``openreview_note_id`` or
    ``openreview_notification_sender``, which the pipeline reads from the raw
    text whichever path ran. Note the distinction a null ``extraction`` carries —
    absent means the row was never examined, whereas a present result with
    EMPTY lists means it was examined and nothing was found.

    ``openreview_reply_candidate`` is DERIVED here exactly as it is on the
    pipeline model — see its own note for why mirroring it as a stored field
    would have reintroduced, at the wire layer, the very drift it exists to
    prevent.

    Field ORDER matches the pipeline model deliberately, so the two can be read
    side by side; nothing asserts key order, so this is for humans.

        contradicting the two fields beside it, and would then be able to
        represent a state the pipeline can NEVER produce. A mirror that can say
        something its source cannot has drifted, which is the exact failure this
        class's docstring warns about. Deriving keeps the two identical by
        construction instead of by anyone remembering.

        recomputed on validation, so BOTH models independently reach the same
        answer from the same operands and cannot disagree.
