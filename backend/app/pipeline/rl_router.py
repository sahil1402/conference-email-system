"""RL routing layer — an epsilon-greedy multi-armed bandit over routing lanes.

This is an *additive* learning layer on top of the rule-based router, not a
replacement: the same ``RoutingDecision`` contract is returned, and the hard
safety rules (sensitive intents always escalate; a low-confidence floor always
escalates) are preserved before the bandit is ever consulted. The bandit only
gets to choose among lanes once an email is past those guards and clears the
confidence threshold.

Arms (actions):     "auto_reply" | "human_review"
Reward signal:      approved → +1 win (the lane was right)
                    rerouted → trial recorded, no win (the lane was wrong)
State:              per-intent {action: {wins, trials}}
Persistence:        JSON (human-readable) under backend/models/

The stored lane vocabulary is "faq"/"human_review"; the bandit's arm vocabulary
is "auto_reply"/"human_review". ``faq`` and ``auto_reply`` are the same action —
``_normalize_action`` maps ``faq`` → ``auto_reply`` so feedback and routing agree.
