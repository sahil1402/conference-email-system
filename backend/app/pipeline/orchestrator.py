"""Pipeline orchestrator (classify → retrieve → draft → route → persist).

Wires the four pipeline modules together and the persistence layer behind a
single entry point, `process_email`. It owns sequencing, timing, persistence,
and audit logging — the modules themselves stay unaware of each other and of
the database.

The router runs AFTER the drafter: the FAQ-vs-human_review lane is a property
of the generated draft's completeness/groundedness/self-rated confidence, not
of the classification alone (see `app.pipeline.router`).

Failure policy:
- A failure in classify / retrieve is fatal: it is logged and re-raised with
  status "error" (no partial record is persisted).
- A failed draft is non-fatal: the partial result is persisted with status
  "draft_failed" and returned (the drafter itself never raises). Routing then
  runs on that (possibly failed) draft.
