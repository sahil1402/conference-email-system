"""Intent taxonomy — the single source of truth for classification intents.

Data-mined from ~18.5k inbound tickets (blind LLM induction, chair-tag validated,
year-persistence filtered — see docs/local/CLASSIFICATION_REWORK.md §4). Replaces
the hand-crafted 11 intents. Every other module (distiller, keyword fallback,
router, template drafter, KB labeler) imports from here — do not hardcode intents
anywhere else.
