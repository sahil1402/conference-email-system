"""Re-evaluate open tickets after a KB change (the chair's "re-evaluate" button).

One sweep re-runs retrieval for every open ticket using the query captured at
ingest (no model call) and re-drafts only the tickets whose grounding set moved.
Chair-edited drafts are never clobbered. The sweep runs in its own DB session so
it can be scheduled as a FastAPI background task after the request returns.

Gate (design §3): a ticket is *affected* iff the set of fresh top-k policy ids
differs from the set stored at draft time. Comparing sets (not ordered lists)
means a pure score reshuffle — same chunks, different order — does not force a
needless re-draft.

Two passes so the queue reflects the whole batch, not one ticket at a time:
- Pass 1 (gate + claim): fast, no model calls. Every affected ticket is claimed
  (``redrafting=True``) and audited ``ticket_redrafting`` up front, so the UI
  shows the entire batch "re-drafting…" at once.
- Pass 2 (draft): the slow per-ticket model calls. Each ticket's new draft is
  saved and its flag cleared as it lands, so the chair watches them resolve one
  by one and can see which are still in progress.

    means the active-status rule is re-checked: a policy retired since it was
    forced is correctly dropped, and that drop shows up in the gate below as a
    genuine grounding change.

    This also keeps the gate honest. The stored ids include the forced policy, so
    a fresh run WITHOUT it would differ from the stored set on every sweep and
