    --------------------------------------
    Caching was the cheaper option and was rejected on correctness, not effort:

    * ``post_comment_reply`` posts to the readers of the parent note as fetched
      AT POST TIME, and never to a list ConfMail computed. A stored copy could
      therefore show a chair one audience while the post reaches another — and
      the whole reason this field exists is that a chair approving a public
      relay should see who will see it. A display that can disagree with the
      action it is authorising is worse than no display.
    * Filling it at detection time would put an OpenReview API call on the
      INGEST path — inside the Zendesk poller, across every synced ticket,
      requiring OpenReview credentials to be configured before ordinary email
      processing works. Extraction is deliberately text-only (it has no
      OpenReview API integration at all, by design), and this commit is not the
      place to reverse that.

    WHAT LIVE COSTS, AND WHAT PAYS IT
    ---------------------------------
    The call is made ONLY for a genuine reply candidate carrying a note id, so
    every other email — the overwhelming majority, and every row of the main
    queue — pays exactly nothing and this endpoint behaves as it always did.
    For a candidate it is one bounded call on a page a chair opened deliberately,
    one at a time.

    Failure NEVER propagates. Any exception becomes the ``failed`` state and the
    rest of the email still renders; a broken OpenReview must not be able to
    take the detail page down with it.

    THE THREE STATES ARE THE POINT. ``not_applicable`` (not a candidate, so
    there is no parent comment and no audience to show) and ``failed`` (there IS
    an audience, but we could not read it) are completely different facts, and
    collapsing them would hide a real error behind a UI that simply shows
    nothing. ``readers`` is ``None`` in both, never ``[]`` — an empty LIST is a
    fourth, genuine fact ("fetched; the note names no readers") and must stay
    distinguishable, exactly as a null ``extraction`` stays distinct from an
    examined-but-empty one.

    For the case where a reviewer or author replied to an OpenReview
    notification and their answer landed in the chair inbox instead of on the
    forum. The chair reviews it and, if it should go where it was meant to go,
    calls this — and the reply is posted under the ORIGINAL comment, visible to
    exactly the people who could see that comment.

    Ordering is deliberate and every step is a precondition of the next:

    1. The gate (``authorize_openreview_post``) decides on the email row alone —
       no I/O — and both outcomes are audited, mirroring ``/send``.
    2. The parent note is FETCHED. This proves it exists and is not deleted, and
       it is where the readers come from.
    3. The reply is posted, threaded under that note, to those readers.

    4. The Zendesk ticket is auto-solved. Relaying the reply IS the resolution,
       so the chair does not click twice.

    THREE OUTCOMES, not two, and the response says which. The OpenReview comment
    is public the instant step 3 returns and cannot be un-posted from here, so a
    Zendesk failure afterwards must never be reported as though the whole action
    failed — a chair who read "failed" and retried would either be blocked by the
    idempotency gate or, worse, post twice. Nor may it be swallowed: the ticket
    is genuinely still open and somebody has to close it. See

    re-routes → re-drafts in the background, clearing the flag when the new draft

    whatever retrieval ranks — see ``EmailPipeline._force_policy_chunk`` for the
