"""`extraction` is served by the email API, with its NULL semantics intact.

The load-bearing distinction carried all the way from the DB layer:

  * ``extraction: null``              — the row was never examined (it predates
                                        the column). Nothing is known.
  * ``{"submission_numbers": [],      — the row WAS examined and no submission
     "method": "llm_distiller"}``       was found. That is a real finding.

Coercing the first into the second (or into ``{}``) at any layer destroys it,
so these tests assert through the REAL endpoints via ASGITransport rather than
calling ``_email_to_dict`` directly — a serializer can be correct while the
route around it is not.

The serving path does NOT go through the schemas.py mirror: `_email_to_dict`
forwards `email.extraction` (the raw JSON column) verbatim, and no route on this
router declares a `response_model`. The mirror is therefore a declared contract
that nothing enforces at runtime, which is exactly why the end-to-end tests at
the bottom of this file assert against real HTTP bytes and then validate those
bytes through the mirror, rather than trusting either one alone.

SCOPE LIMIT: reading only. No endpoint consumes or filters on `extraction`, so
nothing here asserts on querying or filtering by it.
