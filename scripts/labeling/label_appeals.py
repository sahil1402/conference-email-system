"""Hand-labeling CLI for the Phase 1 reject-appeal set.

Walks data/labeling/phase1_appeals_2025-09-20_to_30.jsonl one ticket at a
time and records a human judgment into the two label fields that extraction
left null (``is_reject_appeal`` / ``appeal_reason``). Stdlib only.

This tool is DELIBERATELY UNASSISTED. It shows the raw ticket text and the
taxonomy, and nothing else: no keyword highlighting, no scoring, no
suggested answer, no ordering by "likely appeal". Anything that nudged the
labeler would leak into the labels and quietly bias the very ground truth
this set exists to provide.

Order is a fixed shuffle (SEED), computed over ALL ticket ids rather than
over the unlabeled ones, so the sequence is identical on every run and
stopping/restarting resumes the same walk instead of reshuffling. Already
labeled tickets are skipped, which is what makes the tool resumable.

Three states, not two. A ticket is LABELED (``is_reject_appeal`` non-null),
DEFERRED (``deferred`` true, labels still null -- parked by [s] as too
unclear to call now), or UNTOUCHED. The default run shows only untouched
tickets, so a deferred one stops resurfacing every pass; ``--review-deferred``
shows only the deferred ones, for a dedicated revisit. Labeling a ticket in
either mode clears its deferred flag, so the three states stay disjoint and
always sum to the file's row count.

``deferred`` is migrated in LAZILY. It is defaulted in memory at load, but
that alone never triggers a write: a run that changes nothing leaves the file
untouched on disk. The field reaches disk with the first real change, which
rewrites every row anyway.

Durability: after every single label the WHOLE file is rewritten atomically
(temp file in the same directory -> fsync -> os.replace). A crash, a Ctrl+C
or a power cut can therefore lose at most the answer being typed, never the
file: the original is replaced only once the replacement is complete on
disk. SIGINT is held for the duration of that rename and re-raised after,
so Ctrl+C lands between writes and never during one.
