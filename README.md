## Overview

Conference program chairs receive hundreds of emails per cycle — submission deadline questions, formatting queries, visa letter requests, review conflicts, and appeals. Most are repetitive and answerable from public policy documents. A small fraction require genuine human judgment.

ConfMail separates these two classes automatically.

**FAQ Lane** — High-confidence, policy-grounded emails are answered automatically. No hallucinated policies. Every response is traced to a source document.

**Human Review Lane** — Novel, ambiguous, or sensitive emails are routed to a chair queue with an AI-generated draft. Chairs can approve, edit, or reroute with a full audit trail. As of Phase 6, this lane branches further: instead of landing in one generic queue, each email is assigned to the specific chair responsible for that area (Program, Diversity & Ethics, Local Arrangements, Publicity/Sponsorship, or General as fallback) — with reroutes between chairs captured as a future training signal.

The system is designed as a research platform: every component (classifier, retriever, router, chair assignment, drafter, database) is modular and config-flag-swappable, with reinforcement-learning-based routing and local-only deployment already implemented for conferences with external API restrictions.

### Pipeline Stages

Every stage is a swappable, config-flag-controlled module — none of these are phase-gated placeholders; all backends listed are live for each stage unless marked planned.

| Stage | Backend Options | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Classifier | `keyword` · `trainable` | Trainable backend uses sentence-transformers embeddings + LogisticRegression, exposed via `/api/v1/train/classifier` |
| Retriever | `bm25` · `faiss` · `fusion` | Grounds replies in the real **AAAI-27 policy corpus** (93 chunks parsed from 6 official AAAI policy documents — call for papers, submission instructions, code of conduct, publication ethics, publication policies, and a cross-reference guide — each tagged from its document frontmatter and section headings). `bm25` is lexical; `faiss` uses sentence-transformers (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) with `IndexFlatIP` cosine similarity; `fusion` is reciprocal-rank fusion over both. Both `bm25` (from the corpus file) and `faiss` (from the DB) now surface chunk tags — tag parity across backends |
| Router (lane) | `threshold` · `rl` | RL backend is an online, epsilon-greedy contextual bandit updated on every approve/reroute |
| Chair Router | `intent_mapping` · `learned` (planned) | Assigns human-review emails to a specific chair by matching classified intent against each chair's owned areas; falls back to a general/catch-all chair on no match. Reroutes are logged as the future training signal for a learned assignment policy |
| Drafter | `anthropic_api` · `local` · `template` | `local` targets an Ollama-compatible endpoint (pending GPU compute); `template` is a zero-dependency, zero-API fallback |
| Database | `sqlite` · `postgresql` | SQLite for MVP, PostgreSQL migration-ready via asyncpg + Alembic |

> Chair-assignment UI (assigned-chair badges, filter-by-chair, reroute-to-chair dropdown, routing-rationale panel) is planned for Phase 6B, once the backend chair router is verified.

## Configuration

All backend behavior is controlled by config flags in `backend/.env`:

```env
# Classifier backend: "keyword" | "trainable"
CLASSIFIER_BACKEND=keyword

# Retrieval backend: "bm25" | "faiss"
RETRIEVAL_BACKEND=bm25
FAISS_MODEL_NAME=all-MiniLM-L6-v2

# Lane routing strategy: "threshold" | "rl"
ROUTING_STRATEGY=threshold

# Confidence threshold for auto-reply routing (0.0 – 1.0)
CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD=0.65

# Classifier confidence calibration (Platt scaling). Defaults False pending
# held-out validation — see Roadmap, Phase 5B.
CALIBRATION_ENABLED=False

# Chair assignment strategy: "intent_mapping" (learned/RL planned)
CHAIR_ROUTING_STRATEGY=intent_mapping

# Model provider: "anthropic_api" | "local" | "template"
MODEL_PROVIDER=anthropic_api
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
# Required when MODEL_PROVIDER=local (Ollama-compatible endpoint)
# OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434

# Database backend: "sqlite" | "postgresql"
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///./conference_email.db
```

> Known status: with calibration enabled, in-sample routing accuracy improves from 74.1% to 94.8% (Phase 5B) — but `CALIBRATION_ENABLED` stays `False` by default until validated on held-out data, and the Analytics reliability diagram flags in-sample results with an amber caveat rather than presenting them as ground truth.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- Node.js 18+
- An Anthropic API key (for `MODEL_PROVIDER=anthropic_api`) — not required for `local` or `template`
- Docker Desktop (optional, for one-command spin-up)

### Quick Start (Docker)

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

### Backend Setup (manual)

```bash
cd backend

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate      # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add your ANTHROPIC_API_KEY if using MODEL_PROVIDER=anthropic_api

# Run migrations
alembic upgrade head

# Start the server
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

API available at `http://localhost:8000`
Interactive docs at `http://localhost:8000/docs`

### Frontend Setup (manual)

```bash
cd frontend

npm install
cp .env.example .env.local
# Set NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000/api/v1

npm run dev
```

App available at `http://localhost:3000`

### Seed the Database

```bash
cd backend
python scripts/seed.py
```

This loads the toy email dataset — including the multi-chair dataset — and runs the full pipeline on each.

### Run the Eval Harness

```bash
cd backend
python scripts/run_eval.py
```

Runs the pipeline against the ground truth set and reports sklearn classification metrics as a JSON report.

| GET | `/api/v1/retrieval/info` | Active retriever backend + index stats |
| POST | `/api/v1/train/classifier` | Train the trainable classifier backend |

---

## Domain Model

### Email Intents
`FAQ_DEADLINE` · `FAQ_FORMAT` · `FAQ_SUBMISSION` · `REVIEW_ASSIGNMENT` · `VISA_LETTER` · `APPEAL` · `AMBIGUOUS` · `OTHER` (extended set as classifier taxonomy grows — see Roadmap, Phase 6A)

### Routing Lanes
`AUTO_REPLY` — answered automatically from KB
`HUMAN_REVIEW` — routed to a specific chair's queue with an AI draft (Phase 6A)

### Chairs (new, Phase 6A)
Program Chair · Diversity & Ethics Chair · Local Arrangements Chair · Publicity/Sponsorship Chair · General Chair (fallback). Each chair owns a configurable list of intent/topic areas; `Email.assigned_chair_id` records the assignment, and reroutes between chairs are captured in the audit log as a future training signal for a learned assignment strategy.

### Email Lifecycle
`PENDING` → `CLASSIFIED` → `ROUTED` → `DRAFT_GENERATED` → `APPROVED` → `SENT` → `ARCHIVED`

> Note: pipeline-assigned statuses are uppercase; action-endpoint statuses (approve/reroute) are lowercase in the current implementation.

## Roadmap

### Phase 0 — Scaffold ✅
Monorepo structure, FastAPI backend, Next.js 14 frontend skeleton, config flags, async SQLAlchemy + Alembic.

### Phase 1 — Data Layer + Pipeline ✅
Toy dataset, knowledge base, all 5 pipeline modules, REST endpoints, seed script.

### Phase 2 — Full UI ✅
Full Next.js 14 frontend — dashboard, split-pane review queue, auto-replies, recharts-based analytics, audit timeline; hooks for queue/analytics/audit/actions; dark-mode design system.

### Phase 3 — Research Extensions ✅
Real pagination/filtering audit endpoint, PostgreSQL migration readiness, local LLM backend, trainable sentence-transformers + LogisticRegression classifier, epsilon-greedy RL bandit router wired into approve/reroute feedback.

### Phase 4 — Retrieval, Eval & Reporting ✅
FAISS retriever, expanded ground-truth eval set, `scripts/run_eval.py` CLI, living progress PDF generator.

### Phase 5 — Calibration, Fusion & Production Readiness ✅
- **5A**: Eval/tracing infrastructure; retrieval confirmed not the FAQ routing bottleneck; eval set expanded to 58 emails
- **5B**: Platt-scaling calibration; routing accuracy 74.1% → 94.8% in-sample; `CALIBRATION_ENABLED` defaults `False` pending held-out validation
- **5C**: Reciprocal rank fusion retriever — honest negative result, does not beat FAISS alone
- **5D**: Template drafter — third zero-dependency drafter backend, completing the set (`anthropic_api`, `local`, `template`)
- **5E**: SSE-based live queue updates + calibration reliability diagram in Analytics
- **5F**: Chair-edit diff view (LCS word-level diffing) + keyboard shortcuts in the review queue
- **5G**: Active-learning flagging (`low_confidence`, `meaningful_edit` signals; candidates endpoint; no auto-retraining yet)
- **5H**: Model-agnostic Drafter adapter specification
- **5I**: Docker Compose (live-verified) + three-job secret-free CI on GitHub Actions
- **5J**: Demo walkthrough recording — pending

### Phase 6 — Multi-Chair Routing 🔄 (in progress)
- **6A**: Multi-chair routing backend — DB migration complete (`Chair` table, `Email.assigned_chair_id`, 5 chairs seeded); classifier intent taxonomy extended to give every chair a genuine auto-routing path; `chair_router.py` (intent-to-chair strategy) in progress; toy dataset covering all 5 chairs
- **6B** (planned): Frontend for chair assignment — assigned-chair badges, filter-by-chair, reroute-to-chair dropdown, routing-rationale panel, per-chair analytics
- **Held-out validation** (planned): validate calibration (5B) on held-out data before enabling by default
- **Real conference dataset** (planned): pending AAAI dataset approval

**Outstanding blockers:** NCSA Delta GPU allocation (for local draft generation) is still pending. The **policy corpus is now the real AAAI-27 knowledge base** (93 chunks, see archive/README.md for the corpus unification); the **email dataset remains synthetic** (toy emails) pending real conference email traffic.

---

## Research Context

This system is developed as part of a research initiative at the **Melady Lab, University of Southern California**, exploring the application of AI pipelines to academic conference operations.

The architecture supports ongoing research in:
- Active learning from human reviewer decisions
- Online reinforcement learning for conference email routing using contextual bandits with human-in-the-loop feedback
- Learned, feedback-driven chair assignment — using reroute events as training signal (Phase 6+)
- Retrieval-augmented generation grounded in conference policies
- Evaluation of AI-assisted human-in-the-loop workflows

---

## Contributing

This is an active research project. If you are a collaborator:

1. Branch from `main`
2. Work in feature branches (`feature/phase-6a-chair-routing`, etc.)
3. All pipeline changes must preserve the `classify → retrieve → route → draft` interface contracts
4. Do not hardcode model names anywhere — code, comments, docs, UI, or commit messages. Use only capability-descriptive identifiers (`anthropic_api`, `local`, `template`)
